Just had to post this photo of Steve today walking at West Kirby the first time he has walked with his frame beyond the boundaries of home in a very very long time - the look of joy on his face says it all ðŸ˜Š this was the man who was in such a dark place only 16 months ago with very little hope for the future - however with all your support and his determination he has a future that looks so much brighter - we will never be able to thank you all enough - I will keep you all updated love to all Janet
