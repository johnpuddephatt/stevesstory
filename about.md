title: Hear Steve’s Story
---
Everyone has a story to tell, this is Steve’s Story.

- Family man
- Loving husband
- Completed the 3 Peaks and Triathlons for charity
- Great friend
- Working at Levers, Port Sunlight
- Always active
- Always keeping fit
- Keen hill walker
- Avid traveller

Until 2009 that is, when at the age of just 50 Steve received a life changing diagnosis of Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.

Since that day Steve has battled this life changing, debilitating illness.  Whilst selflessly putting himself forward for medical trials with the hope of preventing future generations from facing what he has had to.

But now there is hope on the horizon.

Unfortunately Steve does not meet the criteria for treatment by the NHS in London, but he has been accepted for HSCT (Haemeotopathic Stem Cell Treatment) in Mexico.

Mexico has a 95% success rate for this treatment, which sadly won’t cure Steve but will hopefully stop his MS in its tracks with the bonus of reversing some of his disabilities enabling him to enjoy an active life and positive future.

But like many of these pioneering treatments it comes at a huge cost.
Please help us raise £50,000 for the treatment.

Thank you for your support and please spread the word.
