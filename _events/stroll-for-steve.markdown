Adam, Stephen, Mike, Ste, Alex, Phil and Jack are walking the Wirral coast (all 35 miles) in aid of www.stevesstory.co.uk on Saturday 3rd December.

Everyone is welcome to join them (for some or all of the walk), support (buy us a pint?) or sponsor them at the link below

[www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/strollforsteve](http://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/strollforsteve)

They will be starting at Birkenhead Ferry Port at 7:00 a.m. in festive fancy dress and hopefully finishing up there in the evening!

Hope you can join in to help Steve reach his target!
