A **massive **thank you to all who came along and supported our launch event at Port Sunlight Rugby Club,  everybody had a great night and we raised the magnificent sum of **£2,200**.

To build on this our pamper package raffle runs for another week, by donating £3 to Steve's You Caring page and putting pamper package in your message you'll be entered in the draw, which takes place on Saturday 15th October, good luck.

We've also got a signed Liverpool Football Club shirt - tickets for that are just £5 a go, look out on facebook to see how you can get them.
