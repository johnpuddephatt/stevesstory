Well what a way to end this year confirmation has now been received from Mexico my treatment will commence 27th February, Janet and I will be flying out on the 25th and returning 25th March.  Although our target of Â£50,000 has not yet been reached we have borrowed from a fund set up by my family for my aftercare to enable me to be treated as soon as possible as my condition is deteriorating.  Fundraising will continue in the new year, events will be added to the site as soon as the committee have caught their breath following the numerous events held in the three months running up to Christmas.  None of this would have been possible without the help and support of each and every person who has not only donated money but time and support throughout this campaign, may I thank you all from the bottom of my heart, my family and myself will be eternally grateful.  We wish you all a very happy New Year - Steve x
