Many thanks to Linda (novice runner) who was challenged by her hubby Steve (very accomplished runner) to compete in the Regents Park 10K run today to raise funds for Steve's Story.

Linda took on the challenge, trained religiously, and completed her mission in 66 minutes!!  Huge congratulations to Linda and Steve, thank you both so much for your support for our cause. Final figure for money raised coming soon.
