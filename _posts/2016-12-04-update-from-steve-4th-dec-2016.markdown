Well what can I say 11 weeks since we launched with what felt like an unachievable amount to raise, little did I realise the support of friends and family and total strangers I would have around me.  An astonishing amount of Â£30,755 has been raised so far.  I would like to thank each and every person who has been involved whether that be by way of donating or giving up their time to help me reach my goal for this life changing treatment.  What a weekend we have just had a fabulous Mexican Themed Christmas party, with artists giving their time for free, Stroll for Steve on Saturday, sale of left over books and DVDs from the attic sale the other week, Santa Dash this morning in Liverpool and another raffle in B & M Queensferry this afternoon.  Thank you everybody from not only myself but Janet Alison Adam and Poppy along with the rest of our family, without you all this would not be happening - bring on Mexico !!!
