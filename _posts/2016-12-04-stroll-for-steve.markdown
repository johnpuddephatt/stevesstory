Well done to all the boys, Stephen McGuinness, Adam McGrath, Phillip Hay, Jack Stewart, Ste Shakespeare and Mike Ashton on their fantastic effort  on Saturday 3rd December when they set of at 7:00 a.m. to walk all 35 miles of the Wirral Coast!!

14 hours later 3 of them completed completed the event, sadly the other 3 had to pull up at 30 miles due to leg problems.

A tremendous achievement by all and over Â£1,400 raised for Steve's Story - thank you so much boys, you're real heroes xx
