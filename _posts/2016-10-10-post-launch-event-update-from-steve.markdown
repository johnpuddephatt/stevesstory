Well what a few weeks it has been who would have thought we would smash £10k prior to the launch party! What an unbelievable achievement my thanks go to all the committee who are working relentlessly to make this happen for me.  

The launch party held on Friday the 7th October was a fabulous night not only did it raise £2,200 it was amazing to see so many family and friends and now new friends, some of whom traveled far and wide to be there, to see old work colleagues from 25 years ago was to say the least emotional.  

I thank each and every person for all their efforts and donations it means so much to me and my family.  Lets keep the momentum going - together I know we can do this - maybe one day I will walk up those steps of Port Sunlight Rugby Club and not have to be carried !!
