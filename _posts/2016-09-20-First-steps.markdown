Well where do I begin!

Just over a week ago the fundraising started and I cannot believe the response, I am absolutely overwhelmed by people's generosity, not only donating financially but also the time people are giving up to support me and spread the word.

No words seem enough to express my gratitude.

With your support I can now see some light at the end of what has been for the last 7 years a very dark tunnel.  I have renewed hope for a better future not only for myself but also my family and friends.  

I have renewed motivation to try to stay as fit as I am able to undertake this mammoth HSCT journey. Next week toning tables Tuesday and Wednesday if I can make it and physio appointment Thursday.

Take care everyone have a good week. Steve.
