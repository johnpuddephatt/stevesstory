I am so amazed and overwhelmed through all the hard work of the committee and donations from family, friends and people I don't even know.  The attic sale today raised an outstanding £780, thank you so much to each and every person, your generosity is phenomenal.  Little did I know or could I have imagined that in just eight weeks a staggering £21,739 could be raised to help me and my family, we all thank you so much, Steve xx
