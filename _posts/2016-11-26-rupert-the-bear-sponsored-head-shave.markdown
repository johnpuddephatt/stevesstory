Many thanks to Rupert who put himself forward for a sponsored head shave to raise funds for Steve's Story.

The head shave took place on Friday 25th Nov at The Merebrook.  Thanks also to Nat from Boy Barbershop for kindly agreeing to do the head shave and to Graham Harris who sold raffle tickets at the event.  Thanks to all involved for their support and for helping Rupert to raise a fantastic Â£750 for our cause.![IMG-20161126-WA0017.jpg](/uploads/IMG-20161126-WA0017.jpg)
